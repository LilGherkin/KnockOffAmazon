## Make a Purchase
After entering the make a purchase option you are then prompted to select an item form the list using it's ID. Then, select the amount of units you would like to purchase. After entering in that information the applicaiton will tell you how many units of that item you bought, and the total cost of the purchase as a whole. The database will then update for the new adjusted quantity.
